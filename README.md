# Tic-Tac-Amigo

Group4 of the BNTA mini project to model a game of tic-tac-toe. Our game comes with both a PVP and vsComputer mode available!

By Aaron, Michelle, Rosa and Will.



## Project Description

### MVP Task
The game you will model is tic-tac-toe, AKA noughts and crosses. Your app will need to:

- Have a recognisable layout
- Allow two players to take alternate turns
- Be able to identify which area of the grid a player wants to mark on their turn
- Determine a winner

### Extensions we implemented

- Allow the player to enter their name instead of being "player 1" or "player 2"
- Be able to restart the game without reloading the page
- Keep track of how many games each player has won
- Let a single player play against the computer



## Setup Instructions

    1. Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/WillBurdett/Tic-Tac-Amigo.git
    2. Open in Visual Studio Code (VSC).
    3. Run game using VSC's Go Live tool.
